        <!--present: one article with heading and aside, two divs with two images in each
             - flex organises either rows or columns
             - <article> is for complete and independent content(usually in the main page),
             - <aside> is for content relating to the main page.
            1. remove <article>, move <aside> content below image divs.
            2. design guide represents more than one row/column, so a grid would work best - the aside spans two rows.
            3. wrap content in grid container.
